# Image-Classification-Algorithms

- You can find two python notebooks in this repository. 
- Open Google colab/Kaggle and upload the notebook above. 
- Run each cells one by one to get the results
- Only change that needs to be done is to upload the dataset to the drive and copy the link for the folder and paste it inside the notebook where the variable name is "sdir" and then you are good to go with the project.
